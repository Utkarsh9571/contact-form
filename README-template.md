### What I learned

The most important thing i learned from this challenge that i exhausted my energy for 2 days because i added (required) in the inputs, for which browser has its own error message, so i don't know if i need to disable it and then my custom error messages will show, but this was very frustrating, don't know why gemini didn't point out this detail that i have this in my input tags that's why i can't see my custom error messages.

next thing i need to do is to either change the colors of radio buttons selections or add an icon on that, the code from gemini is hard to understand now and there is no video on youtube so i'll leave that for later, i tried to do that for checkbox but works only half way through, so i thought i'll do them both together.

next in order to make the color change for the selected radio button div, i need to make an extra functuion which doesn't work properly, but was working enough unitl you navigate by keyboard, it goes in radio buttons but did not show in it, it will select is when you press space then show it.
